**SpectraScan** is a high-performance, multi-threaded network scanner written in Python. It goes beyond simple port scanning by integrating OS fingerprinting, SSL/TLS analysis, HTTP enumeration, and vulnerability heuristics. Designed for security professionals, pentesters, and network administrators.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Multi-Protocol Scanning**: TCP, SYN, and UDP scanning with configurable timing profiles.
- **🛡️ Stealth & Evasion**: Decoy generation, rate limiting, and firewall detection.
- **🖥️ OS Fingerprinting**: TTL-based and response-time-based OS detection.
- **🔐 SSL/TLS Analysis**: Certificate inspection, cipher suite analysis, and protocol version checking.
- **🌐 HTTP Enumeration**: Server header analysis, allowed methods, and path discovery.
- **📊 Rich Reporting**: Export results to JSON, CSV, and beautiful HTML reports.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized with `concurrent.futures` and async-friendly structures.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Advanced Recon**: Ping sweep, ARP scan, and traceroute capabilities.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Root/Administrator privileges (required for raw socket/SYN scans)

 Generate HTML Report
    python SpectraScan.py -t target.com -o report.html -f html   

## ⚙️ Configuration

Timing Profiles
Adjust the speed and stealth of the scan:

T0: Paranoid (Very slow, high stealth)
T1: Sneaky
T2: Polite
T3: Normal (Default)
T4: Aggressive
T5: Insane (Fastest, least stealth)

Common Ports
The scanner includes a predefined list of common ports (FTP, SSH, HTTP, MySQL, etc.). You can specify custom ports using -p.
